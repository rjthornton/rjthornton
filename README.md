- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, d&d, and now making apps to support my online d&d group. I recently discovered that getting my code right is just as satisfying as defeating a Souls boss so I've been coding more than gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I'm trying to change careers and become a web developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on online apps aimed at supporting people who play d&d remotely. However, I'm still a novice programmer. 
- 📫 If you want to reach me, please DM me and I'll send you my email address.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Japanese and currently live in Japan, teaching EFL.
